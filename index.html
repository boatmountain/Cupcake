        <h4>How we got here.</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Â¿Que Pasa?  As a young boy I used to love sundays gatherings at my grandma's house because of her tasty treats.  Eventually word got out that she had the best cupcakes in town.  The neighbors began paying her and she couldn't refuse.  A few months later the neighbors brought in more business and she was overwhelmed with orders.  The family started to help out and eventually Grandma Cece created a cupcake shop out of an old, decrepit, barely standing post office.  Cece's Cupcakes has been open everyday since it's opening in 1953.  We beleive that everyone should access to a palatable cupcake at least once a day.

        <h2>Perfection by hand</h2>
        <h5>Things we are infamous for</h5>
        <h4>Passion</h4>
        <p>We love that customers enjoy what fills us with joy.  Our staff aims to create an experience that allows for a moment of jubilee with every bite.  We want our customers to feel the same way Cece intended for her family at those family gatherings.  Let our cupcakes take you somewhere simple, comfy, and memorable.</p>
        <h4>Quality Ingredients</h4>
        <p>As you can imagine being infamous for delicious cupcakes takes plenty of trial and error.  Over time Cece noticed some of her family investing in larger clothes.  This wasn't the intention of Cece and she discussed her concerns with multiple people who managed to not buy larger clothes.  The secret was ingredients; she found the best ingredients to maintain the taste without offestting the scales of those who enjoyed her cupcakes.  Rest assured our cupcakes will make you feel and look great.  We use non-lectin ingredients to accomodate those with the most unqiue diets; nobody should be denied a cupcake regardless of what condition they're in.</p>
        <h4>Community</h4>
        <p>We aren't very good at making customers pay.  Our emphasis has always been high on feeling good.  Sometimes people can't afford a cupcake and we try to create ways for that not to stop them from enjoying them.  Our young customers can get a free cupcake for each book they read, our older customers can get a free cupcake for riding our electro-cycle in front to charge our generator, and our elder customers can get a free cupcake by mentoring less seasoned individuals in a variety of fields.  If someone can't fulfill those then there is always room to negotiate other possibilities.  We just like to remind people that community is important to us and we reward communal efforts. </p>
